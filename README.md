# VANILLA JAVASCRIPT CALENDAR TASK TRACKER

## A fully functional Javascript calendar task tracker built from scratch

This project is a challenge I am working on, that consist in building this project without the help of Chat-gpt or videos on how to do it. I can only look at the Javascript documentation and 
videos on Youtube about the Date object in Javascript.

This purpose of this project is to help myself to track my progress in my programming journey, although it can be useful to track any type of project You might be working on. 
As someone who likes setting goals a day, I wanted to keep track of the progress I make everyday, and be able to review what I worked on in previous days or months.

Therefore I decided to build this program. The functionalities are the following:

* User can pick any day in the calendar and create a Todo List for that specific day or the other days down the road. (User can't be able to do this to days that passed already)
* User can delete, mark as completed or update the tasks in the Todo List
* Once that day in which the user set up the Todo List passed, user can review his progress and leave a detailed comment about the work done in that day.
